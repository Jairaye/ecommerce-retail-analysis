**Comprehensive retail analytics demonstrating marketing efficiency measurement, customer segmentation, and performance optimization**

This project analyzes a full e-commerce retail dataset to uncover opportunities in marketing efficiency, customer value, regional performance, and revenue optimization. It mirrors the analytical responsibilities of a Commerce Insights & Analytics role, with a strong focus on ROAS measurement, customer segmentation, A/B testing, and actionable insights.

---

# Project Overview

This analysis evaluates key retail performance drivers across:

- Marketing efficiency and ROAS  
- Regional revenue gaps  
- Customer segmentation and lifetime value  
- Device usage and conversion behavior  
- A/B test evaluation and discount strategy  
- Seasonality, trends, and forecasting  

The goal is to illustrate how data can inform marketing allocation, campaign design, and customer growth strategy.

---

# Business Context

The project simulates real-world expectations for a Commerce Insights & Analytics team:

- Tracking media effectiveness and ROAS  
- Analyzing campaign results and lift metrics  
- Identifying category-level and region-level performance patterns  
- Supporting test-and-learn programs through A/B evaluation  
- Translating complex data into actionable insights  
- Optimizing marketing spend for maximum profitability  

---

# Key Findings

## Marketing Efficiency

- Total Revenue: $1.44M  
- Total Marketing Spend: $273.7K  
- Overall ROAS: 5.28x  
- Beauty delivers **30.5x ROAS**  
- Electronics absorbs **48% of marketing spend** but returns only **4.1x ROAS**

**Recommendation:** Reallocate 15–20% of Electronics marketing budget to Beauty and Fashion to increase total portfolio ROAS.
